This is the *Chatbot with Python* project I made myself.


<p>Get started building your own simple chatbot! This project will guide you through creating a console-based assistant in Python that can exchange greetings, take your name, and solve basic math problems.<br>
Learn the basic concepts to bring your friendly, calculating assistant to life. You will learn how to take input from users in your program. You will also learn how to make your programs more interactive with if statements and loops. Discover how to declare functions to structure your program.
