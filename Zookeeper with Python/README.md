This is the *Zookeeper with Python* project I made myself.


<p>Have you ever wondered what it's like to peer into different animal habitats? With this project, you'll be able to build a simple monitoring system using Python! Think of it as a virtual zoo visit from your console. You'll dive into the basics of Python and learn how to handle data input and output.<br>
This project will teach you how to take user commands and display animal information, making you feel like a real zookeeper. You'll use lists to organize your data and loops to keep the program running. In the end, you'll have a fun, interactive tool that shows off your new Python skills and lets you explore the animal kingdom from your screen.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/98?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card">https://hyperskill.org/projects/98</a>
